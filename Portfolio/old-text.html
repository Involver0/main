        <p>Sorry, Data. The Federation's gone; the Borg is everywhere! Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Computer, lights up! The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Computer, belay that order.</p>

My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Your head is not an artifact!
